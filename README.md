# Data-driven_Building_simulation_Polimi_EETBS
In this repository, you found the notebooks and data regarding the lessons on Data-driven building behaviour prediction and simulation which have been offered in the context of "Energy and Environmental Technologies for Building System" course at Politecnico di Milano.

Regarding the first case, the notebooks and implementations are the simplified version of a part of implementationsthat my M.Sc student [Manoj Manivannan](https://github.com/manojm18) had developed in his thesis project. The dataset which is employed in this project is consumption data of a residential Building in Austin Texas. The complete results of the study has been published in this [paper](http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/11/1905). 

The Data corresponding to only one building is provided in this repository (considering the Pecan St. Inc' license agreement) ; in order to have access to the device consumption of several buildings provided by Pecan Street you shoudl create an account(free for Academic use) on [DataPort] (https://dataport.cloud/).
